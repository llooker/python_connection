# Python Connections for Data Science

This project contains a sample ipython notebook with code to connect to the Looker API (through HTTP endpoints) for common data extraction functions. 

Looker also provides you with the option to leverage a Python SDK via Swagger for full API Access. You can leverage the API here: https://discourse.looker.com/t/generating-client-sdks-for-the-looker-api/3185
