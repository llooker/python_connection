# Python Connections for Data Science

This project contains a sample ipython notebook with code to connect to the Looker API (through HTTP endpoints) for common data extraction functions. 
This sample code allows you to 
1. Get Data from a Look 
2. Get Data from a Query
3. Get Data from a Query Slug

Looker also provides you with the option to leverage a Python SDK via Swagger for full API Access. You can leverage generate the SDK here: https://discourse.looker.com/t/generating-client-sdks-for-the-looker-api/3185
